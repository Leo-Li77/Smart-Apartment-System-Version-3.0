# Smart-Apartment-System-Version-3.0
Refactor the structure of the older versions. In this version I use Extension to make the Driver more simple. The Driver is now only used to interact with user (to   display menu and to get option from user).
Points to Note:
 1. You can see the update details in the head of the Driver Class of each version.
 2. You can see the funtion and structure by scanning my notation added to each block.
